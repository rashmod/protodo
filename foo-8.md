We will plan and execute this product using lifecycle-based planning as the primary guiding strategy.
The product should evolve through clearly defined stages (for example: MVP, early SaaS, growth, scale), and after the MVP stage, the application should always remain usable as a real SaaS product, not a half-built system.

Other planning strategies (feature-based, vertical slicing, capability-based, category-based, constraint-driven) will be used within each lifecycle stage, but they must not break the usability of the product for that stage.

In rare cases where a large architectural or systemic change cannot be delivered incrementally while keeping the app usable, we allow explicit version-based releases (e.g., a “v2” style transition). These should be intentional exceptions, not the default mode of execution.

The goal is to simulate how a real SaaS company ships, operates, and evolves its product over time—prioritizing continuous usability, realistic tradeoffs, and staged maturity over theoretical completeness.
